## Important dates
- Feb. 28, 2022-- Submission deadline.
- March 26, 2022 -- Notification of acceptance.
- April 10, 2022 -- Camera-ready papers due.
- TBD -- Workshop.

## Background and Envisaged Scope

Starting with reviews on products on e-commerce sites and ending with the emotional effect presentin or intended by media coverage, research in automatic Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis as wellas explicit and implicit Emotion Detection and Classification has flourished in the past years.  Theimportance of the field has been proven by the high number of approaches proposed in research in thepast decade, as well as by the interest it generated in other disciplines, such as Economics, Sociology,Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management  Digital Humanities. Building on previous editions, the aim of WASSA 2022 is to bring together researchers workingon Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications toother NLP or real-world tasks (e.g.  public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, socialmedia mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspectsof affect computation from text.  For this edition,  we encourage the submission of long and shortresearch and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:

- Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies, e.g.  COVID-19
- Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
- Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection- Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
- Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis- Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl.  personality analysis and profiling
- Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
- Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
- Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- The role of emotions in argument mining- Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
- Multimodal emotion detection and classification- Applications of sentiment and emotion mining

## Organizers

### Dr. Jeremy Barnes 
Dr. Jeremy Barnes is an assistant professor at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHUand a member of the IXA NLP group.  He holds a PhD in computational linguistics from PompeuFabra University in Barcelona on Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis for Under-resourced Languages.His research focuses on creating resources and NLP models for under-resourced languages and scenar-ios, including cross-lingual methods, weak supervision, multi-task learning, and domain adaptation,and he has worked extensively on sentiment and emotion analysis.

### Prof. dr. Orph ́ee De Clercq
Prof. dr. Orph ́ee De Clercq is assistant professor of language technology for educational applica-tions at the LT3 Language and Translation Technology Team of Ghent University.  She has extensiveexperience in deep semantic processing of natural language, readability prediction and text miningof (subjective) user-generated content using machine learning techniques.  Regarding the latter shehas  explored  new  techniques  for  aspect-based  sentiment  analysis,  ported  this  pipeline  to  differentdomains and languages and successfully finalized a valorization project with the industry.  Currentlyshe is also looking into implicit sentiment analysis and emotion detection.  She has published in someof the leading NLP conferences and journals and has co-organised several shared tasks on sentimentanalysis in the past.

### Dr.  Valentin  Barriere
Dr.  Valentin  Barriere is  a  PostDoc  researcher  at  the  European  Commission’s  Joint  ResearchCenter of Ispra.  During his PhD, he worked on affective phenomena detection in oral interaction.He mainly worked with graphical discriminative models using features leveraging the robustness andthe high accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms with the fine-grained modeling of linguistic rules.He is now working on multilingual sentiment analysis and multimodal content analysis.

### Dr. Shabnam Tafreshi
Dr. Shabnam Tafreshi is an assistant research scientist at University of Maryland, Applied Re-search Lab for Intelligence and Security.Research interests:computational semantic understandingacross languages.  She is working towards improving NLP models to better extract knowledge fromthe text by complementing NLP models with meaning constructs. Better models are needed for down-stream tasks in text classification and knowledge extraction.  In addition, her research is focused onmethodologies for collecting and annotating quality data for building robust NLP models.

### Dr. Sawsan Alqahtani
Dr. Sawsan Alqahtani is an applied scientist in Amazon Web Services, developing leading AI tech-nologies.  She obtained her PhD in Computer Science from George Washington University (2019).Her thesis focuses on the development of full and partial diacritic restoration and its impact on down-stream applications.  Her research interests include the development of cross-lingual and multilingualmodels especially in low resource settings for different NLP tasks including conversational agents.

### Prof.  dr.  João  Sedoc
Prof.  dr.  João  Sedoc is  an  assistant  professor  of  Technology  in  the  Technology,  Operationsand Statistics department at New York University.  He holds a PhD in computer science from theUniversity of Pennsylvania on Building and Evaluating Conversational Agents (2019).  His researchfocuses on conversational agents with a keen interest in understanding empathy and emotion andapplying  these  models  to  improve  conversational  agents.   He  has  published  in  some  leading  NLPconferences and co-organised several workshops in the past.

### PD  Dr.  Roman  Klinger  (he/him)
is  a  senior  lecturer  at  the  Institute  for  Natural  LanguageProcessing (IMS) at the University of Stuttgart.  He studied computer science with a minor in psy-3
chology, holds a Ph.D. in computer science from TU Dortmund University (2011), and received thevenia legendi in computer science in Stuttgart (2020).  Before moving to Stuttgart, he worked at theUniversity of Bielefeld, at the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing, and theUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst.  Roman Klinger’s vision is to enable computers to understandand generate text regarding both factual and non-factual information.  This finds application in inter-disciplinary research, including biomedical text mining, digital humanities, modelling psychologicalconcepts (like emotions) in language, and social media mining.  He co-organized several workshopsin the past, including two editions of WASSA.

### Dr. Alexandra Balahur
Dr. Alexandra Balahur is scientific officer at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centrein Ispra, Italy.  She holds a PhD in Computer Science, obtained with the thesis entitled “Methodsand Resources for Sentiment Analysis in Multilingual Documents of Different Text Types” (2011).Her main fields of interest are sentiment analysis (opinion mining), emotion detection, informationextraction and textual entailment.  She is the author of over 80 scientific publications,  in journalsand conference proceedings.  She has been the main organizer of the WASSA workshops.
